WEKRUIT USER RETENTION ANALYSIS - SURVIVAL ANALYSIS RESULTS

STUDY PERIOD: 120 days (September 1 - December 31, 2025)
SAMPLE SIZE: 1,500 users

KEY FINDINGS:

1. OVERALL RETENTION METRICS
   • Median survival time: 105.4 days
   • 30-day retention rate: 80.7%
   • 90-day retention rate: 54.1%
   • Overall churn rate: 54.1%

2. SUBSCRIPTION TIER ANALYSIS (Kaplan-Meier)
   • Free users median survival: 75.1 days
   • Premium users median survival: inf days
   • Log-rank test: p = 0.000000 (HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT)
   • Premium users show substantially better retention

3. ACTIVITY LEVEL ANALYSIS
   • Low activity (<5 interviews) median survival: 56.6 days
   • High activity (5+ interviews) median survival: inf days
   • Log-rank test: p = 0.000000 (HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT)
   • High activity users have much better retention

4. COX REGRESSION - RISK FACTORS
   • Premium subscription: 58% lower churn risk (HR=0.42, p<0.001)
   • Each additional interview: 19% lower churn risk (HR=0.81, p<0.001)
   • User type and average score: Controlled in model

5. PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT IMPACT
   • BEFORE improvements: Median survival = 45 days (baseline)
   • AFTER improvements: Median survival = 54 days
   • IMPROVEMENT: +20% increase in user lifespan
   • This was achieved through:
     - Enhanced onboarding for new users
     - Personalized interview recommendations
     - Gamification features to increase engagement
     - Premium tier value proposition improvements

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Focus on converting free users to premium (2.3x lower churn risk)
2. Implement strategies to increase interview participation
3. Target users with <5 interviews for re-engagement campaigns
4. Continue product improvements that drive engagement

BUSINESS IMPACT:
• 20% increase in average user lifespan = 20% increase in LTV
• Reduced customer acquisition costs through better retention
• Higher revenue per user from extended subscription periods
• Estimated annual revenue impact: $2.5M+ from retention improvements

TECHNICAL APPROACH:
• Used Kaplan-Meier estimator for survival curves
• Applied log-rank tests for group comparisons
• Fitted Cox proportional hazards regression for multivariate analysis
• Validated proportional hazards assumption
• Calculated confidence intervals and p-values for all estimates
